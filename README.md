# wavelet-decomposition

For this algorithm we will accept as input only 512x512 grayscale images.
I prepared a particular folder with Lenna and Peppers :).
To understand better the algorithm check the .xls file posted. 

!BUGS and things to do if you want to fork and continue the project:
1. Error should be 0 not 1
2. Also you shoud check if numeric updown value are correct for each vertical/horizontal operation

Happy coding!
